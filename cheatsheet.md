**Physical layout**
The game is set inside a house with 7 rooms, which are connected to each other by exits which can be on the north, east, south, or west side of each room. Each room can only have up to 4 exits/adjacent rooms. There is a foyer at the north of the house, a kitchen, dining room, and bathroom in the middle, and a sunroom, bedroom, and living room in the back. A message room north of the outside of the house also exists, it is where the player transmits messages to Janet. 


**Challenges**
**Locked Rooms**
Some rooms require the input of a 1 word or 1 number password for access to their inventories. 
Most of the required books are located in locked rooms, so unlocking these passwords is essential to the gameplay

The passwords can be found by using LOOK on the non-book items around the house, and reading them for hints 

**Collecting the 8 Books**
Janet asks the player to use the hints below to collect 8 specific books from the house.
Once collected, the player will have to bring the books in their inventory to the message room, 
where they can send them to Janet. If all 8 are correct (order doesn't matter), the player wins and the game ends.
If they are not correct the first time, the player will have 3 more attempts to send the correct books, or lose the game.
